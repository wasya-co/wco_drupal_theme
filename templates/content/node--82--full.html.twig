              <h3 class='lobster' >Performance</h3>
              <p>React JS uses a virtual DOM, which helps in increasing the performance of the web application. It allows developers to update only the parts of the page that need to be changed, without requiring a full reload of the page.</p>

              <p>React JS components are reusable, which makes the development process faster and more efficient. Developers can easily reuse components across multiple projects, which saves time and effort.</p>
